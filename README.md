# The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants

This project explores L-systems (Lindenmayer systems) as a way to model the algorithmic structures found in plants and natural forms.

It is currently a work in progress. The codebase and structure are evolving rapidly, and major changes are expected on a weekly basis as the project matures.

The goal is to experiment with generative algorithms, formal grammars, and visual representations of growth patterns inspired by the foundational work *The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants*.

## Development Status

This is an early-stage, experimental project. Expect breaking changes, incomplete features, and ongoing refactoring.
